## DOPA Virtual Machine

http://www.dopa-project.eu

This is a portable DOPA testing and development environment. It consists
of a set of configuration scripts that automate the creation of a virtual
machine that runs Stratosphere.

The virtual machine makes it easy to learn about using, modify, and improving the
DOPA platform software Stratosphere.


## Prerequisites

You'll need to install recent versions of Vagrant and VirtualBox.

 * VirtualBox: https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads
 * Vagrant: http://downloads.vagrantup.com/

Next, you'll need a copy of the vm that you can downlod from this git repository.

## Installation

If you download the content of this repository and extract it to a
directory of your choice. Once you do that, open up a terminal or a
command-prompt, and change your working directory to the location of the
extracted (or git-cloned) files. From there, run `vagrant up` to provision and
boot the virtual machine.

You'll now have to wait a bit, as Vagrant needs to retrieve the base image from
Canonical, retrieve some additional packages, and install and configure each of
them in turn.

If it all worked, you should be able to browse to http://localhost:8080/ and
see the main page of your DOPA test instance.


## Usage

To access a command shell on your virtual environment, run `vagrant ssh` from
the root the directory you downlaoded the virtual machine to.
